Mandarin Game

This is a simple dynamic flashcard website.

The website is inspired by the wonderful language learning website www.babadum.com

I am not (yet) a programmer, but I wanted to understand how to make a simple version. I first paid a developer to help me create a static Javascript version. You can check it out here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mtokudome/mandarin_game/blob/master/index.html

But then I wanted to understand how to make a dynamic version. So I paid another developer on Fiverr to help me make a PHP version that uses a SQL database.

From there, I have tweaked a little with the look and feel. I'm using a free SQL database host (https://remotemysql.com/) and hosting this simple website on Heroku (https://quiet-sea-32061.herokuapp.com/).
